            <p>Corpus Christi Food Pantry and Assistance, Inc. is a 501 (C) 3 non-profit established in 1999 by the Roman Catholic parishes of Nashua to better meet the needs of the people of Nashua. Corpus Christi Food Pantry and Assistance is a safety net for families (in need of food and financial assistance) who do not qualify for government assistance or for whom that assistance is not sufficient or delayed in coming. All services are offered to help prevent hunger and homelessness and to help clients and their families on their journey to achieving self-sufficiency. They are offered without regard to race, religion, country of origin or gender.  While our roots originate from the local Roman Catholic Parishes, no church affiliation is required to receive our services.</p>
