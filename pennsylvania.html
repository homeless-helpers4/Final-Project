            <p>The Good Samaritan Shelter provides safe, comfortable housing for men, women, and women with children experiencing homelessness in the greater Phoenixville and Ephrata areas. Our work is based on Christian principles and though we gladly accept people of all faiths, we ascribe God’s power to help our residents through their struggles and to allow us to help them as best as we can. The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us to love our neighbors by taking care of their physical and emotional needs. We believe that God loves the poor and those experiencing homelessness and we strive to serve them by helping them get back on their feet.</p>

            <p>Catholic Harvest Food Pantry operates one of the largest food pantries in York County. Our pantry is unique in our area in that we are the only pantry to distribute food five nights a week. Distribution also takes places on the first and third Thursday mornings and on the fourth Monday and fourth Friday of each month from 3:45-4:45pm. There are typically more than 700 families each month who use our services and it seems our numbers grow each year. Many of the families who come to us are working but do not make enough to keep food on their table. In addition to food distribution we also provide clothing and miscellaneous household items. We will continue to develop and offer meaningful services to meet the needs of the families we serve.</p>
