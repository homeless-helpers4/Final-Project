            <p>Since 1982, The Food Bank of Western Massachusetts has been feeding our neighbors in need and leading the community to end hunger. We distribute food to our member agencies in Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden and Hampshire counties. These independent pantries, meal sites and shelters are on the front lines of emergency food assistance in our region, playing a crucial role helping individuals, families, seniors and children.In addition to food distribution, we also serve as an important resource to all of our member agencies to help strengthen the emergency food network, increase their capacity, and develop long-term projects to fight the underlying causes of hunger in our community.
