      <p>In the state of New Jersey there have been over 8,941 person who are homeless. Most of people who have become homeless had a job and a stable residence before anything had happened. The reason for why they were homeless was because there was a rapid change in their economic and social factors. Not everybody becomes homeless because they may have lost their jobs or of the rapid change is their economic/social factors. They also become homeless because they may struggle with substance abuse, have a mental illness, fleeing from domestic violence, or their veterans. Since they have some type of struggle they are most likely kicked out of their home.

       <p>Person #1
<br> 1. There could be many reasons why. For example, being born into a poor family, or losing their job. 
<br> 2. Yes, I do feel bad because I see them struggling and it’s hard. 
<br> 3. I want to give them a home, clothes, and food so that they can live a better life. 
</p>
      </div>
      <div class="well">
       <p>Person #2
<br> 1. Their reason for being homeless vary. Some are cast out of their families, some lose jobs, and some made bad decisions. All of these situations ultimately leading to their current condition of being homeless. 
<br> 2. I do feel bad for them. They are struggling within themselves and sometimes all it takes is a simple donation for them to realize they have reason to be here and to get there back on their feet. 
<br> 3. I want to make sure they know that they have a reason to live and we care about them.

      <div class="well">
       <p>Person #3
<br> 1. People might become homeless because they might of been kicked out of their home for doing drug or not meeting a certain “requirement” in their home when they were young. They also might of had a lack of opportunity for jobs. Lastly a mental disorder. 
<br> 2. Yes, because everyone should have the right to have a home, food, clothes, and other basic necessities. 
<br> 3. Provide food, money, and clothing. Collect money to fund a shelter to provide nice housing for them.

      <div class="well">
       <p>Person#4 
<br> 1. Some people are born into a poor family and therefore end up being homeless. Others lose their jobs and then their homes. Or waste their money and lose their homes.
<br> 2. I feel bad for them because I never want to see someone suffering and unable to have a shelter on a daily basis. 
<br> 3. I wish I could donate food and clothes to organizations that help the homeless. I also enjoy volunteering at soup kitchens to help people get their meals for the day.
