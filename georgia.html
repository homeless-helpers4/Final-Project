            <p>Homeless members of our community, whom we call guests while they are with us, arrive at the Good Neighbor Shelter in crisis. The loss of shelter, a most basic human need, is the presenting problem. However, many circumstances lead to becoming homeless – there is usually not just one event that pushes a person into homelessness. Thus, there is a need for the shelter to have a program that assists guests in identifying and dealing with a broad range of variables to facilitate the guest’s return to self-sufficiency.</p>
